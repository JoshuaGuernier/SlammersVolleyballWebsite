<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>There are 800 million players worldwide who play Volleyball at least once a week. Volleyball is a team sport played by two teams on a playing court divided by a net. Originating in United States and is now one of the largest participation sports in the world. Volleyball is a sport that is safe, fun and does not require extreme fitness. It’s great for people who want a low-impact sport that will help them get fit without pushing them to their limit.</p>

<h2>How to Play</h2>
<p>A team can hit the ball three times though not by the same person twice consecutively unless when attempting a block. The object of the game is for each team to send the ball over the net onto the ground it on the opponent's court thus earning a point, while preventing the ball from landing within their own.</p> <div class="floatimg"><img src="Images/netjump.jpg" width="640" height="483" alt="netjump"/></div><p> When the receiving team wins a rally, it gains a point and the right to serve, and its players rotate one position clockwise. The ball is put into play by the right back-row player by hitting the ball back into the opponent’s court. The best of three or best of five games will win matches. Each non-deciding game will be won by the team that first score 25, with a deciding game with a first score of 15. All games are won with a minimum two-point advantage (no scoring cap).</p>
